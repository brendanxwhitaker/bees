Figure out why we are trying to remove agents from incorrect positions. 
    DONE = Environment was getting reset, but state was persisting.
Fix negative number of foods
    DONE = Agents are now killed if food <= 0, and ``self.num_foods`` is reset in reset/fill.
Change self.agents to a dictionary. 
    DONE.
Remove dead agents from self.agents.


Changed:    Made logging initialization read in a list of the 10000 most frequent words in the english
            language, and then sort it alphabetically, then read in every filename in the ``logs/`` 
            directory, then pick the first word from the list which isn't already used in a logname, 
            then use that as the log filename for that run.

            Added agent reconstruction to the reset function. 

            Made ``self.agents`` a dictionary where the keys are unique (even across dead agents)
            integer agent ids and the values are the ``Agent`` objects.

            Added several more logging statements, which just use ``f.write()``, which I think is 
            easier. I also added flush statements of the form ``f.flush()`` which ensure that the 
            log output is added to the file in a chronologically sensible way.

            Fixed bug where ``num_foods`` would sometimes become negative. We were sometimes
            trying to remove agents from heaven.
