- Lookup table for features like Jaderberg paper
- Asynchronous stepping of environment
- Shared perception module between policy network and reward network
- Scale up complexity of reward networks over time
- Brainstorm more inheritance than just reward network
- Asynchronous environments for faster agent lifetimes
- Implement a way to evaluate population learning dynamics
- Better experiment management
- Bayesian optimization on policy network to try to get faster performance?
- AutoML Zero?

For now:
Convergence tests for a single policy to fit a reward function of varying complexity
Add in action distribution to reward plots, and amount of food
Consider whether food is having an effect on the reward magnitude
Add in hand-designed features
Run convergence tests with hand-designed features

Convergence test variables:
- Depth of reward network (1 layer, 2 layer)
- Width of reward network (1, 4, 16)
- Input to reward network (action, action + obs)
- Number of agents (1, 3, 5)

For now, keep 1 agent
