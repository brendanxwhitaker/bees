Social Influence as Intrinsic Motivation for Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning
https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08647
Has an interesting set of tasks for evaluation, and also they use certain modules
(like an explicit communication channel for all agents to read/write from/to) that
could be useful.
Figure 10 of this paper does show that in these games, individual agents are motivated
to defect, even though everyone gets more through cooperation. Not sure if I agree with
the exact payoff structure, because only a small degree of cooperation is required to
gain more reward than defecting, which is not too difficult to learn. This is something
to go over in more detail and consider when building the environment. 

Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies

Kind of old but a good resource for ideas about training networks through evolution.
If nothing else, look at more recent papers which have cited this paper.

Good reference for baseline RL algorithms, will find other options through references.
